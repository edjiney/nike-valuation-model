## 📉 Investment Thesis
**"Operational Recovery Priced to Perfection"**
The market is currently pricing NKE at ~$64, implying a rapid V-shaped recovery. My analysis suggests this is optimistic. Even assuming a successful margin expansion (doubling EBIT margins by 2028), the intrinsic value remains below $50 due to:
1.  **Capital Inefficiency:** Declining asset turnover and unproductive cash accumulation ($12B+).
2.  **Valuation Risk:** 82% of the company's value is derived from the Terminal Value, making the stock highly sensitive to long-term interest rates.

This model was built from scratch (no templates) and features:
* **3-Statement Integration:** Dynamic linkage between Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow (Triple-Zero integrity check).
* **Corkscrew Schedules:** Automated debt and PP&E depreciation schedules.
* **DCF Engine:** 5-year unlevered free cash flow projection with mid-year convention discounting.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Automated "Football Field" matrix testing Share Price sensitivity to WACC (7.5% - 9.5%) and Terminal Growth (2.0% - 3.0%).
